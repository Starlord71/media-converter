# Binaries provisioning

**[English](binaries-provisioning.md) | [Español](binaries-provisioning.es.md)**

First-run flow that prepares ffmpeg and yt-dlp in the application data folder
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MediaConverter`). Progress is real (byte-based), and a failure is mapped to a
machine-readable code that the App localizes.

            Core->>Fs: extract the archive or move the file into place
            Core-->>Main: ProgressInfo(100, Installing)
            Core->>Fs: write the version marker
        end
    end

    alt success
        Core-->>Main: OperationResult.Ok
        Main->>Main: open the tabbed workspace
    else no internet or failure
        Core->>Core: ProvisioningExceptionMapper maps the exception
        Core-->>Main: Fail(NetworkError or another code)
        Main->>Main: show the localized message and a Retry button
    end
```

On later runs the language is read from `settings.json` and provisioning starts immediately; if the
binaries are already present and valid they are skipped.
